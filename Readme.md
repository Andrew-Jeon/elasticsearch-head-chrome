## Synopsis

Chrome Extension containing the excellent [ElasticSearch Head](https://github.com/mobz/elasticsearch-head) application.

## Motivation

This was created because ElasticSearch 5 removed the ability to run ElasticSearch Head as an Elastic Plugin.  This offers an alternative to self-hosting in your own web server.  It also has the advantage of bypassing CORS without configuring CORS on your Elastic server.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open the [chrome extensions](chrome://extensions/) 
3. Tick "Developer Mode"
4. Click "Load unpacked extension..." and browse to the folder containing manifest.json
